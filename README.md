## Quick Start
To get started with the project from scratch, ensure you have python version [what version?] installed on your computer

Once python is installed, download the git repository and navigate to the downloaded directory
```bash
git clone git@github.com:ajn2004/WaveTankImaging.git
cd WaveTankImaging
```

To keep a clean development system, it's best practice to create a virtual environment and install the dependencies locally with the following commands

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

From there you should be able to run the code with

```bash
pyton main.py
```
